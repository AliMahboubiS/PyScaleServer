when we create an endpoint model we need to use the pre-trained model in high scalable products
# Description
Synchronous programming is the execution of code in which each task is completed one after the other.
In asynchronous programming, one task can be executed, but the computer does not need to wait for that task to finish before moving onto the next one.  Perhaps a diagram can help you visualize synchronous vs asynchronous programming.
